# User Story

As a User I would like to be able to find meteorite landing locations that are close to me, also i should be able to log into an account (hopefully have an edit account page), I should see the closest 50 meteorite landing locations shown as pins on a google maps plug in, hopefully ill be able to put in meteorite info if you were to click the pins
